This is a fork of RVC that allows models to be trained on Paperspace.

Usage:

1. Clone this repository into the Paperspace machine
2. Navigate into the cloned folder and run 'make install' in the terminal. This step will need to be run every time the machine is restarted.
3. In the terminal run 'make basev1' for RVC v1 required files
4. In the terminal run 'make basev2' for RVC v2 required files
6. Run 'make run-ui' and use the gradio URL that is printed in order to access the GUI

If you want to use Tensorboard, in a separate terminal run 'make tensorboard'
